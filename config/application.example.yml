# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables in the Unix shell.
# For example, setting:
# GMAIL_USERNAME: Your_Gmail_Username
# makes 'Your_Gmail_Username' available as ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"]
# Add application configuration variables here, as shown below.

GMAIL_USERNAME: dantashman@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD: cassidy
ADMIN_NAME: Dan
